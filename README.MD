What Was The Challenge?

A program that converts a number between 1 - 9999 to text

How I Expected The Challenge To Go...

I expected the task to be manageable, but to write the code in the most efficient way to be challenging.

What Went Well...

The more time I spent on the project the more efficient I was able to make my code

What Didn't Go As Planned...

My logic at the end of the project was very different to the initial logic I had planned to use at the start.

Improvements For Future Challenges

The stretch challenge could have been more challenging.
